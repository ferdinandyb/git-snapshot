gitpacking - Advanced concepts related to packing in Git

SYNOPSIS
--------
gitpacking

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This document aims to describe some advanced concepts related to packing
in Git.

Many concepts are currently described scattered between manual pages of
various Git commands, including linkgit:git-pack-objects[1],
linkgit:git-repack[1], and others, as well as linkgit:gitformat-pack[5],
and parts of the `Documentation/technical` tree.

There are many aspects of packing in Git that are not covered in this
document that instead live in the aforementioned areas. Over time, those
scattered bits may coalesce into this document.
